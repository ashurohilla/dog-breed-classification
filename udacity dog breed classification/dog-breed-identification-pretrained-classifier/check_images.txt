Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: VGG and ResNet correctly classified the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg, but AlexNet did not. While VGG and ResNet identified Dog_01.jpg correctly to be German Shepherd, AlexNet wrongly identified it as Gray Fox.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: None of the three model architectures classified the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg. Dog_02 got classified as a Red Fox by ResNet & AlexNet and as dingo by VGG. Meanwhile VGG & ResNet classified Dog_01.jpg as German Shepherd but AlexNet classified Dog_01.jpg as Gray Fox.


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: VGG, ResNet & AlexNet correctly classified Animal_Name_01.jpg as Siamese Cat. VGG & ResNet correctly classified Object_Name_01.jpg as stopwatch, but AlexNet wrongly classified Object_Name_01.jpg as Magnetic Compass.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: In my inference, VGG performed the best out of the 3 architectures, as it correctly classified Object_Name_01.jpg, Animal_Name_01.jpg & Dog_01.jpg. Also VGG showed 100% correct dog match, 93.33% correct breed match, 87.5% match & 100% correct notdog match on the pet_images dataset. So I will select VGG Model Architecure.
